# CsLox - A C# Lox Interpreter

A C# implementation of the Lox language interpreter from the [Crafting Interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com) ebook by [Bob Nystrom](https://github.com/munificent).

This is basically a **jlox** language from the book, with fixed differences between C# and Java.
